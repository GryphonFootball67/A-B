# Gryphon Football App — Progress Summary

**Date:** 2025-04-23

## Overview
This document summarizes all progress made on the Gryphon Football App today. It is intended for sharing with your business partner and for repository documentation.

---

## 1. Main Navigation & User Flows
- **Alumni Flow:**
  - After submitting the Alumni Information Form, alumni are redirected to a main page (`AlumniMainScreen`) with a bottom navigation bar.
  - Tabs: Roster, Discover, Messages, My Profile.
- **Player Flow:**
  - After a player selects their name on the "Select Your Name" page, they are redirected to a nearly identical main page (`PlayerMainScreen`).
  - Tabs order: Discover (default/first), Roster (second), Messages, My Profile.

---

## 2. Roster Tab
- Displays the Gryphon football roster with player names and positions.
- Added a **Filter** button:
  - Allows sorting by Last Name A-Z or by Position.
- Styled with a centered, bold, red "ROSTER" title and a semi-transparent Gryphon football logo as the background.

---

## 3. Discover, Messages, My Profile Tabs
- Currently placeholders, ready for future content.
- Each displays a simple message indicating more features are coming soon.

---

## 4. Alumni Information Form
- Alumni can enter:
  - First/Last Name, Years Played, Position, Industry, Job Title, Company, Phone Number, and optionally upload a photo.
- Submission is allowed even if no photo is uploaded.

## 5. Navigation Logic
- Alumni and Player main screens are registered in the navigation stack.
- Player and Alumni flows are now separate but visually consistent.

## 7. UX & Design Decisions
- Navigation mimics social apps (e.g., LinkedIn) for familiarity.
- Roster tab is visually branded and easy to use.
- Both alumni and player users have a smooth, modern navigation experience.

---

## 8. Next Steps
- Add real content/features to Discover, Messages, and My Profile tabs.
- Connect forms to backend for saving user data.
- Add user feedback (e.g., loading indicators, confirmations).

---

## 9. How to Run/Preview

- Both alumni and player flows are fully functional and ready for demo.

---

## 10. Notes
